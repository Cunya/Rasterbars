Features:

Smoothing around the text edges:
    - Would it be possible to apply an alpha to the text colors when they are near the text edge
    - We dont want to use the bars in the edge smoothing just apply a general alpha to the text colors based on how far we are from the edge of the text geometry
    - Keep in mind that I want the smooth the edges of the text, not the bars
