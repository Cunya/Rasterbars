Here's a plan:

Project Setup:

Create a new directory named rasterbars-demo.
Initialize an npm project inside the directory (npm init -y).
Install Three.js as a dependency (npm install three).
Create an index.html file to serve as the main entry point.
Create a style.css file for basic styling (e.g., full-screen canvas).
Create a main.js file for the Three.js application logic.
Create a shaders directory to hold the shader files.
Inside shaders, create vertex.glsl for the vertex shader.
Inside shaders, create fragment.glsl for the fragment shader (where the raster bar effect will be implemented).
HTML Structure (index.html):

Basic HTML5 structure.
Include a <canvas> element where Three.js will render.
Link style.css for styling.
Link main.js as a module (using <script type="module" src="main.js"></script>).
CSS Styling (style.css):

Make the body and html occupy the full screen (height and width 100%, margin 0).
Style the canvas to fill the entire viewport.
JavaScript Logic (main.js):

Import Three.js.
Create a scene, camera (orthographic is suitable for 2D effects), and renderer.
Create a plane geometry that fills the screen.
Load the vertex and fragment shaders using fetch.
Create a ShaderMaterial using the loaded shaders.
Pass uniforms to the fragment shader:
u_time: A float representing elapsed time (for animation).
u_resolution: A vec2 representing the canvas resolution.
Create a mesh using the plane geometry and shader material.
Add the mesh to the scene.
Implement an animation loop (using requestAnimationFrame):
Update the u_time uniform.
Render the scene.
Vertex Shader (shaders/vertex.glsl):

Basic pass-through vertex shader. It will receive the position attribute and pass it to the fragment shader.
Fragment Shader (shaders/fragment.glsl):

Receive the u_time and u_resolution uniforms.
Implement the raster bar logic:
Divide the y-coordinate by the screen height to get a normalized value (0 to 1).
Use a modulo operation (mod) and a sine function (sin) with u_time to create the moving bars.
Set the pixel color based on the result of the raster bar calculation.
Run and Test

Open the index.html file in a browser to see the effect.
Are you happy with this plan, or would you like to make any changes?
